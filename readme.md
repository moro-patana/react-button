# React buttons:

 1. Create the button component:
    - className
    - variant
    - label
2. use props as an argument of button function.

3. Export the component as default.

4. Import the component button in the app function and the React and ReactDom as well.

5. create a file which will store all the styles(e.g: style.css) and import it in the app function.

6. Add styles to each button by using their classNames.
